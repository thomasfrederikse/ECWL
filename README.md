## Contents
 - MSL_scripts: Scripts used to compute mean sea-level changes from the AR5 estimates with a custom AIS contribution

 - GESLA_scripts: Scripts that read GESLA2 database, compute de-clustered extreme events above threshold, and save as '.mat' file for quick IO

 - Extremes_scripts: Main code that computes the return curves, allowances, and amplification factors

 - Postprocess: Postprocessing of the results for plotting

 - GMT: GMT codes used to create all plots

 - FP_thwaites: contains a netcdf with the sea-level fingerprint for Thwaites glacier

 - mod: contains modules that are called by the other scripts


## How to use these scripts
First, download all necessary data, see below, and make sure to change all paths: they won't automagically point towards the right path. Also make sure that your matlab/python interpreter has the mod folder in its search path.

## MSL_scripts
These scripts (Python) compute the mean sea-level scenarios by adding a custom Antarctica scenario to the AR5 scenarios. This requires the original AR5 scenarios, which can be found from https://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/1/daten/ocean/ar5-slr.html.

## GESLA_scripts
To save a lot of time, the scripts (matlab) in GESLA_scripts read the GESLA2 text files (Get the database from https://gesla.org/), pre-compute the peak-over-threshold data, and save everything in a .mat file.

## Extremes_scripts
The main computation scripts, in matlab

## Postprocess
matlab scripts that read the results, and save them in text format for GMT to be plotted. Also contains 'write_table.m', which creates a table with all results

## GMT
GMT scripts to plot all figures from the main text and supporting information. Get GMT here: https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt. The plots use, and the scripts include some colormaps from:
- Cynthia Brewer's ColorBrewer2 (http://colorbrewer2.org and http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/jjg/cbcont/index.html)
- Fabio Crameri (http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php)
- The cmocean set (Thyng, K. M., Greene, C. A., Hetland, R. D., Zimmerle, H. M., & DiMarco, S. F. (2016). True colors of oceanography. Oceanography, 29(3), 10. link: [http://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/29-3_thyng.pdf])

## FP_thwaites
Contains the input load and the resulting sea-level fingerprints for uniform mass loss from Thwaites.

## mod
All modules called by other routines
